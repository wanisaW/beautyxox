Eye makeup is a type of cosmetics which aims to make the eyes look noticeable and attractive. It is mostly used by females, and by stage performers of all types. Eye makeup is an important part of the fashion and cosmetic industries. Subtle and effective eye makeup, chosen and blended with her skin and eye colour.

Just as highlighting is important, contouring your eyes is a must to fake a larger appearance. Use a dark brown shade, like L'Oréal Paris Infallible 24HR Eyeshadow in Bronzed Taupe, to define your eyes. Apply the shadow just slightly above the crease of your eye to create the illusion that your eyes are larger.

Waterline eyeliner, eyelash extensions, colored contacts, and false eyelashes all pose some risk to your eyes. These types of makeup are applied directly into or close to your eyes, potentially introducing unwanted bacteria. Contact injuries, especially scratching, can also be caused by makeup however our makeup is less dangerous and is actually very
good for ur eyes and lashes
